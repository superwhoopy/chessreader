'''Chess Board internal representation module

Squares are identified by a string with their usual name, from 'a1' to 'h8'. The
global `ALL_SQUARES` is a list of all of the square names.

The module also provides a `BlindBoard` class used to represent a board where
pieces are only distinguished by their color.

# integer) The following variables define these identifiers.
